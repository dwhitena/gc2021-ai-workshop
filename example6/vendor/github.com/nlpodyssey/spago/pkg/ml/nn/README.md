# Neural Network

The inclusion of neural models in the `nn` sub-package is mostly arbitrary.

Not all neural models are useful. For instance, I wanted to implement many recurrent networks for the sake of curiosity,
but in the end, the LSTM and GRU almost always gave us the best performance in natural language processing tasks.

> We might decide - based on your suggestions - to delete some of them to lighten the core package.
