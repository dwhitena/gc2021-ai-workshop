# Example 1 - Python notebook

This example illustrates how AI models come to be. Often this process involves things called "notebooks" where data scientists pre-process data, train models, and export those models to files. To run this example:

- Open this [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I4Op3caTQO6UYJ5K1115pg91lM6l6fYR?usp=sharing)
- Go to File -> Save a copy in drive
- Go to that copy of the notebook
- Click the play button next to code cells (or press Shift + Enter) to execute the code from top to bottom
